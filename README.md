A console poker game created by Emelie Barrington.

This is a school project made for Chas Academy, intended to practice JavaScript modules, classes and object-oriented programming. 

The game is played so far only by a pretend user input, entered in the code. There is no UI yet. The game itself is printed to the console. 

Might continue developing it later!
